    "    - Smoking, pre-existing pulmonary disease\n",

    "    - Neonates and pregnant women\n",
    "    - Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences.\n",
    "    Transmission dynamics of the virus, including the basic reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, modes of transmission and environmental factors\n",
    "    Severity of disease, including risk of fatality among symptomatic hospitalized patients, and high-risk patient groups\n",
    "    Susceptibility of populations\n",
    "    Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control\n"
